This is a cheat menu for Liar's Bar. The previous page on nexus mods got taken down so now it is only available here. To learn how to install it go onto my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@Aphgahn


CONTROLS
 - Left Arrow = Open/Close Menu
 - Right Arrow = Press button
 - Up/Down Arrow = Navigate

WHAT THE TEXT MEANS
The text on each button shows what cards you get e.g King [King] will give you kings. However, Ace [Chaos] will give you aces in devil and basic mode but a chaos card in Chaos mode. Same with Joker [Master], you will get a joker in devil and basic mode but a master card in Chaos.
